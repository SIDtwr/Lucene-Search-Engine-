./ a small deflection theory for curved sandwich plates .   a small\-deflection theory that takes into account deformations due to transverse shear is presented for the elastic\-behavior analysis of orthotropic plates of constant cylindrical curvature with considerations of buckling included .  the theory is applicable primarily to sandwich construction .
