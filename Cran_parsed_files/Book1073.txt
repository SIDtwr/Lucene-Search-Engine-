./ a practical method for numerical evaluation of solutions of partial differential equations of the heat\-conduction type .   three approximate methods for the solution of the nonlinear equation of heat flow in a medium where heat is being generated by a chemical reaction are compared .  the equations are where subscripts indicate partial differentiations and q, k, a are
