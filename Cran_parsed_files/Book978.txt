./ temperature profiles inafinite solid with moving boundary . a numerical solution is presented to the transient heat conduction equation for a cylinder of finite thickness with one moving boundary . the implicit method of solution is developed with conductivity as an arbitrary function of temperature . application is made to a sample case  of re\-entry heating encountered by aerodynamic bodies, with erosion by sublimation and combustion occurring at the body surface .
