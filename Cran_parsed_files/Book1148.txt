./ knudsen flow through a circular capillary . the problem of knudsen flow through a circular capillary has been often discussed, usually by the momentum transfer method .  however, p. clausing gave a rigorous formulation for the problem and obtained an integral equation for which he gave an approximate solution .  from time to time the accuracy of clausing's solution has been questioned and since clausing did not give a rigorous estimate of his error we have reinvestigated the problem .
