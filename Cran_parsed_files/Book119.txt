./ conduction of fluctuating heat flow in a wall consisting of many layers .   van gorcum has pointed to interesting and important analogies between the theory of a passive four\-pole and the conduction of heat waves through stratiform bodies .  this paper generalizes in certain regards van gorcum's ideas and draws their consequences for the case of a solid, bounded by two infinite parallel planes and consisting of any number of layers made from different materials .
