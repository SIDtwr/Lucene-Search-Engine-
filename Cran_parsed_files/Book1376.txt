./ some applications in physics of the p\-function .   the mathematical background and typical applications in physics are presented for a recently tabulated function .  because of its properties, the p function should prove to be a useful aid in the solution of certain problems in applied mathematics involving surface integrations in cylindrical coordinates .  a tabulation of the function in its normalized form is appended . particular attention is paid to the application of the p function to multiple scattering problems involving circular symmetry .
