./ general instability of ring stiffened cylindrical shells subject to external hydrostatic pressure \- a comparison of theory and experiment .   tests are described of a number of machined\-stiffened cylinders subjected to external hydrostatic pressure, and the observed general instability strengths compared with predictions from theories of kendrick and nash .  agreement with kendrick was found rather good .  results also are presented from electrical strain gages which show in detail the growth of embryonic lobes and nonlinear characteristics of deformation at the threshold of buckling .  weakening effects of imperfect circularity are discussed .
