./ the effect of turbulence on slider bearing lubrication . based on prandtl's mixing\-length mechanism, the pressure equation for turbulent flow in slider\-bearing lubrication is derived .  an analytical solution is given and compared with the one for laminar flow .  it is found that the turbulent effect increases the pressure and consequently, the load\-carrying capacity .  however, the power loss also increases .
