./ elastic constants for corrugated core sandwich plates .   the sandwich plate consisting of corrugated sheet fastened between two face sheets is considered .  application of existing theories to the analysis of such a sandwich plate requires the knowledge of certain elastic constants .  formulas and charts are presented for the evaluation of these constants .  the formulas for three of these constants were checked experimentally and found to give values in close agreement with the experimental values .
