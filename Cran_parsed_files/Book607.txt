./ duct flow in magnetohydrodynamics .   this paper is an extension of the work of hartmann \(2\) and shercliff transverse magnetic fields \-\- the simplest class of magnetohydrodynamic problems .  we are concerned here mainly with the boundary value problems associated with flow in ducts with conducting walls .
