./ stagnation point viscous hypersonic flow . several methods have been developed for computing the hypersonic, low reynolds number flow in the stagnation region of a blunt body .  in general, these methods involve complicated numerical solutions .  simultaneous iterations on several parameters are usually required in view of the boundary\-value nature of the problem .   the purpose of this note is to present an approximate closed\-form solution to axisymmetric stagnation point hypersonic flow in the viscous layer regime .
