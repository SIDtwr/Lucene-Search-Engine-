./ recent developments in rocket nozzle configurations .   existing configurations of supersonic portion of rocket nozzles are described and compared .  survey covers bell\-type conical and contoured nozzles, annular nozzles, plug nozzles, and the author's own /e\-d/ \(expansion\-deflection\) nozzle .  the latter is a bell\-type nozzle in which the gases are first deflected radially outward by a small central plug, then expanded radially inward around the base of the plug, and finally deflected back to a nearly axial direction by the nozzle wall, in compressive turning .
