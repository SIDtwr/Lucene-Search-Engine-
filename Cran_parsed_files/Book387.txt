./ heat transfer for laminar flow in an annulus with porous wall .   temperature profiles and heat\-transfer rates of established incompressible flow through an annulus channel with porous walls of constant temperatures are determined at different injection rates . axial conduction and viscous dissipation are, as usual, neglected . injecting fluid is tacitly assumed to have the same temperature as the porous wall .
