./ pitch\-yaw stability of a missile oscillating in roll via the second method of lyapunov . the stability theory of a. m. lyapunov, a popular topic in the u.s.s.r., is receiving increasing attention elsewhere . this note describes lyapunov's /second method/ very briefly and applies it to an aeronautical stability problem .
