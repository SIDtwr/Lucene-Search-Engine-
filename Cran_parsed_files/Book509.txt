./ a graphical approximation for temperatures and sublimation rates at surfaces subjected to small net and large gross heat transfer rates . considers a material, acted upon by heat of conduction, which changes its state by sublimation at the heated surface . the derived method is most suitable under conditions of severe heating such as space vehicle re\-entry .
