./ pressure\-gradient effects on the preston tube in supersonic flow .   this paper is concerned with an experimental investigation of the effects of a longitudinal pressure gradient in a supersonic stream of air over a bounding surface on the performance of a preston or impact\-pressure tube at the surface .  evidence is presented which indicates that for the mach number considered and for the range of pressure gradients covered, the preston tube functions in a completely satisfactory manner for the determination of local shear stress .
