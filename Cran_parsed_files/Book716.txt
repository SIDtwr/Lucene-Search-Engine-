./ study of the oscillatory motion of manned vehicles entering the earth's atmosphere .   an analysis is made of the oscillatory motion of vehicles which traverse arbitrarily prescribed trajectories through the atmosphere . expressions for the oscillatory motion are derived as continuous functions of the properties of the trajectory .   results are applied to a study of the oscillatory behavior of re\-entry vehicles which have decelerations that remain within limits of human tolerance .  it is found that a deficiency of aerodynamic damping for such vehicles may have more serious consequences than it does for comparable ballistic missiles .
